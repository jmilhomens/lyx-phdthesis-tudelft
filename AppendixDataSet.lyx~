Data set characterization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study the same data set used in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bayram2007"

\end_inset

 is used.
 The data set consists on a compilation of several smaller data sets, that
 span in time from 1953 to as recently as 2004.
 There is a big variety of methods used in the data collection, from visual
 observation of wave heights, to the more sophisticated backscattering methods
 of measuring suspended sediment concentration.
 There are also measurements with different time frames, ranging from the
 space of a few minutes to months.

\begin_layout Standard
The longshore transport was estimated from the pumping rate of a sand bypass
 system located at the referred inlet.
 The experiment went on from February to June 1952.
 The wave data was measured at the tip of the Palm Beach Pier (5.5m depth),
 located 15km north of the place of the experiment.
 The wave angle was determined by visual observation, from the rooftop of
 a nearby building.
 The current in the surf zone were measured with a fluorescent dye.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data consists in 3 points of long term measurements.
 The wave measurements were averaged during the period of observation.
 The averaging of results, and the poor accuracy of the wave angle measurements,
 makes this data set somehow unreliable.

Dredged material from the entrance to Anaheim Bay was placed on the downdrift
 (southeast) shore, and repeated surveys of this area were conducted as
 the material was transported in a southerly direction.
 Changes in volume were interpreted as longshore transport rates.
 Estimates of longshore component of wave energy flux were based on: wave
 staff measurements from the Huntington Beach pier about 9 kilometers to
 the south, and wave directions based on hindcasts and recognition of the
 sheltering by the offshore islands for waves originating from certain direction
s.
 This study provided five data points.

The two different locations were chosen in order to collect data under a
 variety of wave conditions.
 The two locations differ significantly in beach configuration and in the
 magnitude of the waves causing the sand transport.
 The direction and flux of wave energy were measured by an array of digital
 wave sensors placed in the nearshore zone.
 Longshore currents were measured using a dye patch injected into the surf
 zone and or floats of near neutral buoyancy.
 Grain diameter and beach slope were also measured.
 In this data set, the sediment transport was measured with tracers.
 Two to four hours after the injection of the dyed sediment, samples were
 collected at points a grid.

 The suspended load was also measured with mechanical samplers.
 The sampling time was kept at 20 min.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wave characteristics were measured mostly with visual methods: wave
 height was measured from visual observation of a graduated pole standing
 at the breaker zone, the wave period with a stop watch and wave angle from
 pictures taken from a bluff.
 The longshore current at the breaker was estimated with a water filled
 balloon or with a fluorescent dye.
 The movements of the balloons and dye were tracked and timed from shore
 during intervals of 5 to 10 min.
 All this measurements were averaged during the sampling time.

An offshore breakwater and twin jetties at the Channel Islands Harbor form
 a unique sand trap, and was therefore an ideal case for measuring longshore
 sand transport.
 This setup is considered to be nearly a total littoral barrier to longshore
 sand transport.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data collection program consisted of periodic bathymetric and topographic
 surveys, routine wave data from which longshore transport and the wave
 energy flux could be calculated, and sediment samples taken during the
 study period to obtain quantitative information on the sand size at the
 site.
 This study lasted three years and was divided in two phases, yielding 18
 data points.

 an 88 paddle directional "snake" wavemaker capable of producing regular
 waves with a single desired direction.
 The main method used to measure sediment transport was impoundment on a

The LST measurements were carried out with streamer traps.
 In two of the data points, at the Indian Rocks beach, short-term impoundment
 was also used.
 The field sites were chosen so wide ranges of morphodynamic and hydrodynamic
 conditions were included.
 Sediment size and beach slope were also measured.
 The traps were mounted on a rack.
 The number of traps on each rack varied from four to eight, depending on
 the water depth and breaker height.
 Depending on the with of the surf zone, three to six racks were mounted
 along a cross-shore section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wave height and period were measured by video recording of scaled photo
 poles.
 At least 20 waves were measured to determine

.
 Five to fifteen wave angles were also measured with an hand-held compass

\begin_layout Standard
This data set was collected using impoundment of longshore sediment transport
 against a shore-perpendicular barrier rapidly deployed across an initially
 undisturbed beach.
 For each impoundment experiment, a shore-perpendicular sand-bag groyne
 was constructed approximately 150 meters south of the FRF pier, during
 the low tide period.
 Usually two beach profile surveys were possible before the surf zone migrated
 offshore of the groyne tip, one during the rising tide, and one during
 the falling tide.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Current was measured with impeller-type current meters (aligned shore parallel),
 mounted close to the bed on jetted steel pipes.
 Directional and spectral wave data was collected by gauges located close
 to the FRF pier.
 Wave height at the breaker was visually recorded, and wave angle was measured
 by HF radar imagery.
 Sediment samples were also analyzed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, impoundment data is considered to be less reliable because of
 the long term character.
 In this case, however, the measurement time is short enough to have constant
 wave characteristics during the experiment.
 There are six points in the data set.

\begin_layout Standard
This experiment made use of optical backscattering sensors.
 The optical backscatter sensor (OBS) allows for a measurement of the sediment
 concentration within the water column in great detail at time scales of
 fractions of a second.
 Measurements were made at at least nine positions across a barred profile.
 The sensors (OBS, electromagnetic current meters, wave gauges, amongst
 others) were mounted in an array fixed to a track-mounted crane that could
 move along the research pier (the Sensor Insertion System, SIS).
 The measurements were made in the most possible stable hydrodynamic conditions
 (within 1.5 hours of high or low tide).
 During this three hour period, several measurements were made along the
 profile.
 Each measurement took 512 seconds, which allowed for the SIS to measure
 at least nine locations on the profile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wave data was obtained from a directional pressure gauge array, located
 at -8 m depth, slightly offshore and north of the research pier.
