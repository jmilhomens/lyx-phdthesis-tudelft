  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a study of alongshore sediment transport rate based on three-dimensional hydraulic model experiments performed with regular and irregular waves. Deep-water wave conditions, wave heights through the surf zone, wave-breaking angles, longshore current velocity distribution, and the bed-load and suspended-load sediment transport distributions are measured simultaneously to form a coherent data set. An expression is developed linking sediment transport rate to wave steepness, beach slope, relative grain size, and breaking angle. The expression compares well with published field data.},
