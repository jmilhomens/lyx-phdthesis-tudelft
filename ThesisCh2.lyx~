Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Wave breaking induced turbulence that reaches the bed, which varies according
 to the wave breaking type, plays an important part on sediment stirring
 and consequently is thought to be an important factor influencing LST rates.
 In this chapter an attempt is made to model this influence.
 For that effect a process based model is developed and implemented.
 This model includes a simple turbulence model and uses a novel parametrization
 for the vertical decay of the wave breaking generated turbulence.
 Laboratory data that includes test cases with different wave breaking types
 is used to calibrate the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The model was able to reproduce the differences in turbulence decay profiles
 between different wave breaking types and produced realistic cross-shore
 profiles of LST.
 Unfortunately no proper validation was possible due to lack of data.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Influence-of-profile"

\end_inset

 the influence of profile features on LST rates calculated with UNIBEST-LT
 was investigated.
 The calculated LST rates varied significantly with the profile used but
 it was unclear which process was responsible for this variation.
 In this chapter I explore the effect of wave breaking type on LST rates.
 The wave breaking type is an indication to how strong is the effect of
 wave breaking induced turbulence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The influence of wave breaking induced turbulence on longshore sediment
 transport (LST) is not explicitly represented in most existing models (e.g.
 UNIBEST-LT 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "VanRijn2007e,VanRijn2007c"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bijker1971"

\end_inset

).
 However, field and laboratory observations indicate that this effect is
 important and an effort must be made to include wave breaking induced turbulenc
e in LST models.
 For example, in a laboratory experiment, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Cox2000"

\end_inset

 identified intermittent episodes of strong turbulence at the bottom inside
 the surfzone and although those episodes were infrequent, the turbulence
 was of an order of magnitude larger than the one generated at the bed.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Beach1992"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Wang2002a"

\end_inset

 also observed the same type of episodic events of high sediment concentration
 high in the water column under breaking waves.
 Field observations in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Grasso2012a"

\end_inset

 showed that wave breaking induced turbulence dissipation at the bed was
 at least two times larger than the current induced turbulence dissipation
 (generated by bed shear stresses), even in the presence of strong alongshore
 currents.
 In another laboratory experiment, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Smith2009"

\end_inset

 measured significant differences on total LST rates between tests with
 different wave breaking types.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wave breaking induced turbulent kinetic energy that reaches the bed
 has the potential to stir a significant amount of sediment and carry it
 higher in the water column.
 However, this happens intermittently in the surfzone 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Beach1992"

\end_inset

 and has been observed to be related to the beginning of the breaking and
 to be more frequent with plunging breakers.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Ting1995"

\end_inset

 observed differences in the turbulence dissipation between spilling and
 plunging wave breaking types.
 The former occurs violently over a short time and across the water column
 (turbulence is transported downwards by the jet) and the latter occurs
 smoothly and is confined to a region near the surface.
 In field experiments, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Beach1996"

\end_inset

 observed that plunging breakers are associated with suspended sediment
 concentrations roughly four to six times higher than the concentrations
 associated with bores and concluded that plunging waves are responsible
 for the greatest share of the suspended load.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Grasso2012a"

\end_inset

 also observed that the turbulent dissipation rate was almost depth uniform
 where waves were starting to break and that it decayed radically with depth
 where bores were predominant.
 Also based on field data, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Aagaard2010"

\end_inset

 concluded that plunging breakers are significantly more efficient in stirring
 sediment than surf bores.
 These results are not surprising when one ponders about the mechanics of
 a plunging breaker where a jet of water is ejected from the crest and falls
 on the base of the wave face.
 This jet penetrates the surface and provokes a downward transfer of turbulence
 that may reach the bed and increase drastically the local instantaneous
 bed shear stress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter I evaluate the effect of wave breaking induced turbulence
 on LST results from a laboratory experiment.
 The LST physical model data comes from the Longshore Sediment Transport
 Facility (LSTF) located at Vicksburg, USA

The laboratory data used in this study were obtained at the LSTF physical
 model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The LSTF simulates nearshore hydrodynamic and sediment transport processes
 at a relatively large geometric scale, including situations where considerable
 sand is mobilized and transported in suspension.
 The LSTF consists of a 30-m wide, 50-m long, 1.4-m deep basin (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Layout-LSTF"

\end_inset

), and includes wave generators, a sandy beach, a recirculation system 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

, sand traps, and a movable instrumentation bridge where instruments can
 be mounted.
 These included wave gauges, Accoustic-Doppler Velocimeters (ADV), Fiber
 Optic Backscatter (FOBS) sensors and a beach profiler.
 The current data imposed by the recirculation system was also registered.
 Sediment traps were installed in the downdrift recirculation flow channels
 to collect sand transported through the downdrift boundary

\begin_layout Standard
Four irregular wave conditions with a relatively broad spectral shape, represent
ing typical sea conditions, were generated in the LSTF.
 The wave conditions were designed to obtain and compare LST rates for different
 breaker types by varying incident wave height and period.
 In this study data from tests 1, 3 and 5 is used.
 The wave conditions are shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 The tests were performed on a movable bed with sediment with 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{50}=0.15$
\end_inset

 mm.
 The profiles were the result of the wave action, and represent equilibrium
 situations.

Within each test, 3 measurement runs were carried out - cases 1, 2 and 3.
 The bathymetry varied slightly from case to case and these small variations
 may be significant to the model.
 For that reason I decided to use data from only one case per test: Case
 3 from Test 1, Case 2 from Test 3 and Case 3 from Test 5.
 The cases were chosen taking into account a subjective appreciation of
 the quality of the data.
 The bathymetry profiles were smoothed to eliminate ripples and are shown
 in figure

The longshore current velocity data points were obtained by depth averaging
 values measured by the ADVs at different depths, weighted by each measurement's
 corresponding water column fraction.
 The values of the current forced by the pumps were also measured and were
 usually higher than the depth averaged ones.
 This may be explained by the presence of a small recirculation current
 close to the wave generators.
 This small recirculation current may also have affected slightly the current
 values at the beginning of the surfzone.

The root mean square wave height and setup data were measured directly from
 the surface elevation time series recorded by the wave gauges.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All bathymetry, velocity and surface elevation measurements considered in
 this study were measured at a position slightly downdrift from the center
 of the basin, preferably at profile Y22 (see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 When data were not available for this profile, the closest profile with
 valid data was used.
 The LST rates were measured by the sediment traps located at the downdrift
 boundary.

 In test 1 UNIBEST-LT over-estimates LST at the beginning of the breaker
 zone and under-estimates values well inside the surfzone.
 In all tests, peaks of LST occurring very close to the shore were measured.
 These peaks are not present in the UNIBEST-LT results.
 I don't know exactly the cause of these peaks but they could be a result
 of transport in the swash zone, excessive longshore current forcing by
 the recirculation system or the combination of both.
 In any case, UNIBEST-LT is not expected to be accurate in very shallow
 water where the assumptions of the model lose validity.

\begin_layout Standard
I also looked at the longshore velocities (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:longshore-velocities-across"

\end_inset

) along the profile.
 Here the model is less successful in replicating the measured velocities.
 The model results seem to overestimate longshore velocities at the start
 of the breaker zone in tests 1 and 3, and underestimate velocities close
 to the shore in all tests.
 It is important to notice that in the UNIBEST-LT results, the longshore
 velocity is the factor that has more influence on the predicted LST.
 This can be seen when comparing figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LST-rates-across"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:longshore-velocities-across"

\end_inset

.
 The suspended sediment concentration seems to play a secondary role.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though the model has some difficulties replicating the longshore velocities
, the results for the total load (LST integrated across the profile) shown
 in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:LST-values-swash"

\end_inset

 are good (within a factor of approximately 2), considering that no fine
 tuning of calibration parameters was necessary.
 The results improve if one excludes the high transport peaks in very shallow
 water (for simplicity I call this area the swash-zone).
 More importantly, figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:measured-vs.-calculated"

\end_inset

 shows that there is an approximately linear relation between measured and
 calculated total loads when considering all tests together.
 This indicates that the model behaves consistently with different types
 of wave breaking.

Although the model predicts total loads with reasonable accuracy, it fails

 Nevertheless, this error is compensated by an underestimation of the suspended

 These two shortcomings cancel each other effectively to give a reasonable
 total load estimation, especially in test 3.

Energy dissipation by wave breaking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The energy dissipation due to wave breaking is the most important and at
 the same time the most difficult phenomenon to simulate.
 In this section I present four models for the energy dissipation by wave
 breaking.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wave breaking dissipation in a wave energy balance model can be represented
 by the product of two factors: the wave breaking dissipation of a single
 breaking wave with a certain height (
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

) and the fraction of waves breaking at a given position of the profile
 (
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{b}$
\end_inset

).
 The later can be understood also as the probability that a single wave
 in a wave train with a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{rms}$
\end_inset

 value is breaking.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D_{b}=Q_{b}B\label{eq:Db}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following the bore analogy suggested in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Mehaute1962"

\end_inset

, the formula for the dissipation in a single breaking wave with wave height
 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
B=\alpha\frac{\rho g}{8\pi}\omega\frac{H^{3}}{h}\label{eq:breaker_dissipation-bore}
\end{equation}

with 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 being a calibration factor

 The goal of this assumption is not to simulate in detail the wave height

 I opted for not using error measures like the root mean square error or
 bias to evaluate the optimal coefficients for two reasons: 1) our goal
 was to have a model that was successful in predicting the trends in all
 tests and these error measures are less capable to evaluate trends and
 2) it is not the goal of this study to fine tune these coefficients.
 Instead I carried out a small sensitivity analysis for the calibration
 coefficients of the longshore current model, using the AB07 dissipation

Results with different wave breaking dissipation formulations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All four breaking dissipation formulations were tested.
 All methods, given the right calibration factors are capable of predicting
 reasonably well the evolution of wave height along the domain (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig: hrms comparison"

\end_inset

).
 However, without calibrating the coefficients of the dissipation formulation,
 wave heights calculated with TG83 seem to be consistently under-predicted.
 The other formulations are more successful in predicting wave heights,
 with R93's results appearing to be the best.
 BJ78 and AB07 result in very similar wave height predictions for all tests.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Concerning the longshore current velocities (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig: longshore current"

\end_inset

) it can be seen that: TG83's results are too high at the beginning of the
 breaker zone in tests 1 and 3, R93's results are too low for tests 1 and
 5 and results with BJ78 and AB07 are generally between the results of the
 other two formulas.
 The only important distinction between the results of BJ78 and AB07 occurs
 in test 3 at the bar, where the later results in predictions that are nearer
 to the measured values.
 This confirms the results obtained in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This area is of crucial importance for our study because the plunging breakers
 occur only there.
 Considering these reasons, the AB07 formulation for wave breaking dissipation
 was used herein.

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few aspects are important to emphasize when trying to build a longshore
 current model: 1) the inclusion of a roller model is very important, especially
 if one wants to estimate the cross-shore profile of velocities on barred
 profiles.
 The difference between results with and without a roller (UNIBEST-LT in
 this case) is presented in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Differences-roller"

\end_inset

.
 The differences are important, especially on test 3 where the bar is more
 prominent.
 The roller distributes the longshore forcing across the surfzone resulting
 in a much more realistic prediction.
 2) Within the roller model, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 coefficient can influence significantly the trend of the velocities across
 the profile.
 This coefficient is understood as being the representation of the wave
 front angle.
 However, it is used as a free parameter in this study.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Walstra1996"

\end_inset

 this parameter was found to be a function of the depth and wave height
 and is expected to vary across the profile having a maximum value of 0.1.
 In our case the expression derived in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Walstra1996"

\end_inset

 did not give better results than a constant value.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:sensitivity-analysis-for"

\end_inset

(a) shows the influence of the value of beta in the results.
 The value found to better simulate the behavior in test 3 was 0.04.
 3) The bottom friction coefficient is also a very important calibration
 parameter.
 It controls the magnitude of the velocity which is very sensitive to this
 parameter as can be seen in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:sensitivity-analysis-for"

\end_inset

(b).
 For the sake of simplicity I opted to consider the bottom friction constant
 along the profile.
 The value that appears to result in a better estimation of the longshore
 velocities was 0.014.

\begin_layout Standard
As noted above, the results using the formulations BJ78 and AB07 are very
 similar except for the zone at the bar crest in test 3.
 This happens because the AB07 formulation dissipates more energy where
 the wave breaking becomes more of the plunging type.
 This appears to be done by increasing the factor that can be interpreted
 as the fraction or probability of breaking waves (eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Db"

\end_inset

) to a value above 1 as can be seen in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:fraction-of-breaking"

\end_inset

.
 This appears to compensate the deficiency in energy dissipation obtained
 with the bore analogy when simulating plunging breakers.

 presented a cross-shore sediment transport model that includes turbulence
 effects.
 In that model a term is added to the suspended immersed weight to account
 for sediment suspension due to turbulence generated by wave breaking (eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:RV89"

\end_inset

).
 This equation can be separated in two terms representing the immersed weight
 suspended sediment transport by the effect of the orbital velocities at
 the bottom 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{ss}=K_{s}\epsilon_{S}\omega_{s}$
\end_inset

 and the transport due to wave breaking induced turbulence 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{st}=K_{s}\epsilon_{T}\omega_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Here I adopt a similar model but accounting for different efficiency factors
 for suspended transport caused by shear stresses due to orbital velocities
 at the bed (

 a coefficient expected to be close to 1.

 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 this variable is related with the wave breaking dissipation through a time
 averaged turbulent energy flux model which has the function of generating
 a delay between production of turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation.
 In the model described in this chapter the roller model already plays that
 role, hence I relate 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\epsilon}$
\end_inset

 directly to the roller dissipation 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{r}$
\end_inset

.
 However, it can reasonably assumed that only a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{2}$
\end_inset

 of the energy dissipated at the roller acts as a source of turbulence in
 the water column.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Feddersen2005"

\end_inset

 estimated the fraction to be 25%.
 This estimation was based on previous estimations that around 50% of the
 roller energy dissipation is used pushing air bubbles in the water column
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Lamarre1991"

\end_inset

 and 25% in turbulent dissipation above the trough level, i.e., in the roller
 itself.
 This estimation is somewhat simplistic and I preferred to use 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{2}$

 as a calibration factor.

\end_inset

 (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 The start of this region is not clearly defined so a degree of subjectivity
 is present in the definition of this cut-off frequency.
 Although velocities were measured at ten vertical positions, the velocity
 time series measured close to the surface appeared corrupted, possibly
 due to the presence of air bubbles.
 Turbulence estimations close to the bed also presented suspicious values
 and were also disregarded.
 I only considered points where all three velocity directions (
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $w$

 The results are shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 where it can be seen that TKE over the bar is significantly higher than
 in the other parts of the domain.
 There are more efficient techniques to isolate the turbulent components,

 and

 by a distance much smaller than a wavelength, which is not the case in

 In Test 3 the FOBS positioned just offshore of the bar crest measured high
 concentrations higher in the water column where the plunging breakers were
 more likely to occur.
 The other tests appear to show mostly sediment suspended very close to
 the bed, most probably due to bed shear stresses generated by the wave
 orbital velocity alone.
 The importance of wave breaking induced turbulence is also visible in the
 values for LST measured by the sediment traps (figure

 it can be observed that for Test 3 there is a significant increase of sediment
 concentration and LST over the bar (almost one order of magnitude), where
 the plunging breakers occur.
 The rest of the domain, with the exception of the swash area is more or
 less constant and well simulated by the LST model without breaking induced
 turbulence.
 There is a need for a better indicator that accounts for the two factors:
 beginning of wave breaking and predominant type of breaker.
 In the following paragraph three parameters are defined.

The most used parameter to indicate the type of breaker is the Iribarren
 number 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Battjes1974a"

\end_inset

 (also known as the surf similarity parameter).
 I used a local version of the parameter, i.e., an Iribarren number value
 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{n}$
\end_inset

 was calculated for every grid point 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 in the domain (with local bed slope and breaking wave height).
 Because 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{n}$
\end_inset

 can be high in places where waves don't break, the length scale was obtained
 multiplying 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{n}$
\end_inset

 by the fraction of breaking waves at each location.
 To keep dimensions correct I introduced a dependence on 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{rms}$
\end_inset

.
 Waves start breaking only on positive slopes (decreasing depth when moving
 towards the shore) so I consider only positive 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{n}$
\end_inset

 values.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\xi}=\left[\xi_{n}Q_{b}H_{rms}\right]^{-1}=\left[\frac{\max\left(0,m_{n}\right)}{\sqrt{\nicefrac{H_{b}}{L_{0}}}}Q_{b}H_{rms}\right]^{-1}\label{eq:lambda_surf_similarity}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the bed slope at each grid point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Iribarren based parameter gives no indication to where most waves begin
 to break.
 One way to express the beginning of breaking is with the cross-shore gradient
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{b}$
\end_inset

.
 To relate this gradient with a wave related horizontal length scale and
 the wave height, and to give it the right dimensions I multiply the parameter
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{rms}$
\end_inset

.
 The parameter may also indicate indirectly the type of breaker.
 The area where there is a strong increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{b}$
\end_inset

 must have a higher steepness because waves with different heights are breaking
 on a shorter space.
 As in the Iribarren number, higher profile steepness values cause breakers
 to be more of the plunging type.
 I am only interested in zones where 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{b}$
\end_inset

 increases so I consider only the positive gradients of this parameter.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{Q}=\left[\max\left(0,\frac{\partial Q_{b}}{\partial x}\right)L_{0}H_{rms}\right]^{-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both parameters described above have a problem: they are both calculated
 with local values of wave height and depth, and thus have no memory of
 what happened with the wave before.
 When a wave breaks it keeps propagating as a bore until all the energy
 in the roller is dissipated.
 When a significant fraction of the waves is propagating as a bore, even
 if there is a high value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{Q}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{\xi}$
\end_inset

, there is no new initiation of breaking and less turbulence is dissipated
 close to the bed.
 To overcome this problem I use a variable that has 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

memory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: the gradient of the roller energy 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{r}$
\end_inset

 (eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:energy_roller-1"

\end_inset

).
 The roller energy increases were waves start breaking and then decreases
 slowly as the roller energy is dissipated.
 To keep the length scale with the right units a simple dimensional analysis
 was performed taking into account parameters that are expected to influence
 the decay of turbulence: 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{rms}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}$

Figure

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{Q}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{\xi}$
\end_inset

 surfzone in Test 3 where the plunging breakers were observed.
 However the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{E_{r}}$
\end_inset

 shows the highest ratio between magnitudes at the bar and inside the surfzone.
 Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{E_{r}}$
\end_inset

 was chosen as an indicator for beginning of breaking and occurrence of
 plunging breakers.

\end_inset

 as a length scale, are shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:measured-TKE-and"

\end_inset

.
 In this figure it can be seen that only the cross-shore positions 6 and
 7 have significant values of breaking induced TKE deep in the water column
 while TKE decays very quickly in the other cross-shore positions.
 It is important to stress that this is a simplistic model and that its
 main goal is to estimate the amount of TKE injected by plunging breakers
 in the water column and its decay with depth.
 Ultimately, the model provides the needed breaking induced TKE value close
 to the bed.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:measured-TKE-and"

\end_inset

 shows non-zero TKE in the water column in the inner surfzone (cross-shore
 positions from 1 to 5).
 However, these TKE values appear not to contribute to longshore transport
 and thus are unimportant to our model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The TKE profiles shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:measured-TKE-and"

\end_inset

 are very sensitive to small variations of the calibration coefficients
 (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Sensitivity-of-TKE"

\end_inset

).
 As said before, this calibration is very crude because only two profiles
 are used (the profiles where the model gives some TKE close to the bed).
 It is expected that these values will not fit a different dataset.
 Only with a much larger dataset, a more robust calibration of the model
 could be possible.

The discrepancy in concentration of transport can have two reasons: a) there
 is some lateral (cross-shore) advection/diffusion of the sediment in suspension
 due to turbulence and cross-shore net velocities (e.g.
 undertow) that are not taken into account in the model and b) the possible
 presence of infra-gravity waves may change slightly the water level and
 make waves break at slightly different positions spreading the area where
 transport occurs.
 A simple approximation to the evolution of the depth-averaged sediment
 concentration cross-shore profile can be calculated with a conservation
 equation.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial\bar{u}C}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(A\frac{\partial C}{\partial x}\right)\label{eq:conserv_eq}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $C=L/V$
\end_inset

 is the sediment concentration (depth-averaged), 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{u}$
\end_inset

 is the residual cross-shore velocity and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is a diffusion coefficient.
 Because our model is depth integrated and the cross-shore velocity under
 breaking waves has a complex residual velocity vertical profile (typically
 offshore directed near the bottom and onshore near the surface) I did not
 make an attempt to estimate the advection term in eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:conserv_eq"

\end_inset

.
 Instead, the effect of the complex vertical profile of cross-shore velocities
 must be somehow included in the diffusion coefficient.
 This coefficient must also account for the possible influence of infra-gravity
 waves on the water level and the spatial spreading of the breaking zone
 and the effect of infra-gravity flows that can also transport (advect)
 sediment in both onshore and offshore directions of the cross-shore transect.
 To simplify the numerical implementation, and taking advantage of the fact
 that the results of the model tend to be composed of individual peaks of
 transport

 and a Green's function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

 The diffusion coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{n}$
\end_inset

 is a crucial parameter in this calculation, which is assumed to be a function
 of the orbital horizontal velocity (

 In this case of the diffusion will take place while the sediment is suspended
 so the time scale used (
\begin_inset Formula $t_{d}$
\end_inset

) is assumed to be proportional to the settling time of sediment falling
 from the top of the water column.
 The Green's function, here presented on a discrete form with the maximum
 at the middle of the series, is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{n}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi A_{n}t_{d}}}\exp\left(-\frac{\left(n-\frac{N}{2}\right)^{2}}{4A_{n}t_{d}}\right)\label{eq:green_function}

In this chapter I analyzed the effect wave breaking induced turbulence on
 LST and made an attempt to produce a predictive model.
 I was able to confirm the importance of the effect on laboratory data.
 The laboratory data set includes three tests, two with mostly spilling
 breakers and one where plunging breakers were predominant.
 The differences between cross-shore profiles of LST were significant (figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Volume-transport-rates"

\end_inset

), with up to an order of magnitude higher values of LST over the bar where
 the plunging breakers were observed.
 This behavior can be caused by: higher velocities, higher sediment concentratio
ns or the combination of both effects.
 Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig: longshore current"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Sediment-concentrations-on"

\end_inset

 indicate that higher concentrations are the main cause as they are significantl
y higher in Test 3 over the bar, while velocities are similar in the three
 tests.
 Another important fact visible in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Sediment-concentrations-on"

\end_inset

 is that Test 3 is the only case where significant concentrations were observed
 higher in the water column.
 These high concentrations are most likely caused by wave breaking induced
 turbulence resulting from the plunging breakers observed by the experimenters.
 Besides that, a sequence of waves that start breaking approximately at
 the same point of the domain can also generate high sediment concentrations
 higher in the water column.
 In this case sediment stirring is done in steps, where the sediment does
 not settle totally between waves and is pushed higher in the water column
 by successive breaking waves.
 This generates higher concentrations on steeper bars where waves with different
 heights start breaking at locations that are close to each other, over
 a short cross-shore stretch.
 These two effects, i.e., plunging breakers and narrow profile stretch where
 waves start breaking may cause the higher suspended sediment concentrations
 observed in test 3.

I attempted to model numerically the phenomena described in the previous
 paragraph.
 For that I chose a Bagnold/Bailard/Bowen model coupled with a simple turbulence
 model.
 The main challenge was to find a factor that accounts for the effects of
 plunging breakers and initiation of breaking.
 The generally accepted parameters that account for these effects (
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{H_{s}}{h}$
\end_inset

 and Iribarren number) depend only on local conditions and have no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

memory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of what happened to the waves before.
 Our solution uses the cross-shore gradient of the roller energy (
\begin_inset Formula $E_{r}$
\end_inset

) as a parameter.
 The increase of roller energy denotes the initiation of breaking and the
 higher the gradient is, the more likely plunging breakers are.
 The dependency on 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{r}$
\end_inset

 has the disadvantages: a) has a different value in the different breaking
 dissipation formulations, b) depends heavily on the empirical factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 (eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:roller-dissipation"

\end_inset

) and c) is quite sensitive to a bathymetry that has not been smoothed to
 eliminate ripples.
 Concerning a) all formulations showed identical behavior with clearly higher
 gradients for the plunging breaker case (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:eroller-with-the"

\end_inset

).

The only test with significant turbulence higher in the water column was
 Test 3 and was therefore used to calibrate the turbulence model.
 Obviously this calibration is poor (I could only use the two points over
 the bar) but I was unable to find another dataset to perform further validation.
 However, the model does simulate the turbulence and longshore transport
 reasonably well in test 3 and is based on sound physical reasoning.
 With these facts in mind it can be argued that the cross-shore gradient
 of the roller energy is a good proxy to sediment concentration in the water
 column and could be included in more sophisticated sediment transport models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For tests 1 and 2, i.e., the cases without plunging breakers, the Bagnold/Bailard/
Bowen sediment transport model was reasonably accurate at predicting LST
 across the profiles as can be seen in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:Volume-transport-rates"

.

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note that transport that occurs very close to the shore
 (I will refer to this area as the swash zone for simplicity, although I
 have no way to confirm that this transport is a result of swash-zone related
 phenomena) seems important in all the 3 tests (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Volume-transport-rates"

\end_inset

).
 In fact it accounts for a significant part of the transport in Test 5 and
 a non negligible part in tests 1 and 3.
 The transport in the swash zone cannot be calculated with the kind of model
 used in this study as its assumptions lose validity on very shallow water.
 Users of such models should be aware that a significant part of the transport
 is not being (directly) estimated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One must also have in mind that this type of models make a number of assumptions
 and simplifications that introduce errors in the predictions,e.g, depth
 averaged velocities and concentrations, longshore uniformity, exponential
 decay of turbulence.
 These uncertainties are dealt with in an empirical way by the tuning of
 the calibration parameters of the model.
 This fact stresses the need for a proper calibration and validation.
